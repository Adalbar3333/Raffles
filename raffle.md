This alias allows you to make raffles that your memebers can join in!

I suggest checkin out `!help raffle create` if you want to create a raffle.

Starting a raffle is easy. Just open an inititave, and run `!raffle "Raffle Name"`. You must create a raffle to use before you can actually start a raffle. 
---
Joining a raffle is simple! Just a quick `!raffle join -desc "Additional Information"` and they have joined. Leaving is just as simple; `!raffle leave` will remove the user from the raffle.
